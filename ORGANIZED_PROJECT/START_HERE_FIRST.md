## 🔗 How to Connect Your Dashboard

Your admin dashboard from `dashboard_project` branch can use these services:

### Example: Login Page
```typescript
// In your admin dashboard LoginPage.tsx
import authService from './services/auth.service';

const handleLogin = async (email: string, password: string) => {
  try {
    const { admin, accessToken } = await authService.login(email, password);
    console.log('Logged in:', admin.name);
    // Navigate to dashboard
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Login failed:', error);
  }
};
```

### Example: Dashboard Page
```typescript
// In your admin dashboard DashboardPage.tsx
import dashboardService from './services/dashboard.service';

const DashboardPage = () => {
  const [stats, setStats] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const loadStats = async () => {
      const data = await dashboardService.getStats();
      setStats(data);
    };
    loadStats();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Total Users: {stats?.users.total}</h1>
      <h1>Total Services: {stats?.services.total}</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
```
